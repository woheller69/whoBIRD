This is a fork of https://github.com/woheller69/BirdLog with some additional capabilities:

- Support for dark/light theme to help in changing light conditions
- A language selector for those of us who run their Android OS in english but want the bird names in their native language. Please note, Android 13+ supports app specific language settings, however, not all vendors decided to make that feature available in their OS implementation, looking at you One+ :-(
- Automatically add a timestamp when saving the database file
- Same smaller and highly opionated UI clean-ups

Over time I might convert to a more modern ui, using Jetpack Compose

Missing:
- A proper Info screen
- CrashLog support
